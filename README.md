## Installation

Carvis can be set up in a couple of ways depending on your preference for running it locally or using Kaggle Notebooks. Follow the steps below to get started:

### Option 1: Using Kaggle Notebooks

<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/fredygerman/carvis-starter-notebook?scriptVersionId=188078001" target="_blank"><img align="left" alt="Kaggle" title="Open in Kaggle" src="https://kaggle.com/static/images/open-in-kaggle.svg"></a>
</br>

1. **Clone the Kaggle Notebook**: Navigate to the [Carvis Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/fredygerman/carvis-starter-analytics-kaggle). Clone the notebook to your account if you want to make changes.
2. **Run the Notebook**: Execute the cells in the notebook. By default, it uses a sample dataset.
3. **Use Your Dataset**: To analyze your own vehicle's data, upload your dataset to Kaggle and update the dataset path in the notebook accordingly.

### Option 2: Running Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Bulalu/carvis
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required Python packages using:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Notebook**: Open the `analytics/starter_analytics.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter and execute the cells. You can use the sample dataset provided `decoded-frames/decoded_can_frames_june_1.json` or replace it with your own data.
